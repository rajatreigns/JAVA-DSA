Problem : Taking Input- JAVA Problem of GEEKS FOR GEEKS
Problem statement: Before implementing any algorithm, we should be thorough with taking inputs. Here, we will learn how to read inputs.
You are given five inputs: a(integer), b(float ), c(long), d(byte), and s(string) respectively.

You need to take the input and print a, b, c, d, and s in a new line. In the code, variable t represents the total number of inputs during execution. Note : Consider using sc.nextLine( ) after byte input to handle any issues with input reading.
Read: Java I/O

Example 1:
Input:
5
2.5
6546854
120
geek for geeks
Output:
5
2.5
6546854
120
geek for geeks
 
Example 2:
Input:
6
3.5
7546854
220
suryansh is Legendary
Output:
6 
3.5 
7546854 
220 
suryansh is Legendary
User Task:
Your task is to complete the provided function IOFunction(). You need to take the input and print a, b, c, d, and s in a new line

Constraints:
All inputs will be within the limits of all datatypes.

Solution: 

public class Geeks {
        static void IOFunction() {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int t = sc.nextInt();
        while(t-- > 0){
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        float b= sc.nextFloat();
        long c=sc.nextLong();
        byte d=sc.nextByte();
        sc.nextLine();
        String S =sc.nextLine();
        System.out.println(a);
        System.out.println(b);
        System.out.println(c);
        System.out.println(d);
        System.out.println(S);


        }
    }
}
